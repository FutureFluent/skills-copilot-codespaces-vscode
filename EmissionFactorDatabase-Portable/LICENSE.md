Emission factors are approximations based on economic input-output analysis and should be used for estimation purposes. For critical applications requiring high precision, consider conducting detailed lifecycle assessments (LCA) or using primary data when available.

**Data Accuracy:**

- Based on Exiobase 3.9.6 (2022 data)
- Country-specific factors derived from multi-regional input-output tables
- Regular updates recommended as new Exiobase versions are released
- Confidence levels indicated for each emission factor

**Commercial Use:**

This database may be used in commercial applications. If you build a commercial product using this database, please:

1. Provide proper attribution to Exiobase
